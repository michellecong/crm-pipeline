In addition to these changes, we added multiple enhancements based on feedback from our community.\n\nSection titled: Feature details\n\n## Feature details\n\nShopify releases a new API version every three months at the beginning of the quarter. Shopify supports each version for 12 months. Updated versions might contain important changes. To take advantage of these changes, update Shopify API versions in major releases of Business Central. Typically, new versions of APIs increase stability and security. They also enable additional capabilities. Starting with this release, the Shopify connector uses the Shopify API that was released in January 2025.\n\nImportant\n\nThe Shopify connector released in 2024 release wave 2 (October 2024) relies on API 2024-07. Shopify supports this API until July 1, 2025. To continue to use your integration, upgrade to the latest version of Business Central before this date.\n\nSection titled: Bulk updates of product variants\n\n### Bulk updates of product variants\n\nShopify deprecated singular product variants in favor of bulk versions. Now, the Shopify connector creates or updates variants in bulk. This change improves the overall performance of the connector because a single call handles hundreds of updates. This change affects the initial creation of products with variants and scheduled updates of Shopify products and variants.\n\nSection titled: Handle the Price Including Tax setting\n\n### Handle the Price Including Tax setting\n\nStarting with this release, the **Price Including VAT** toggle in the **Shopify Shop Card** page no longer affects the creation of sales documents. The app gets the information about whether prices include tax directly from Shopify. This information is helpful when you sell to different markets and use the **Include or exclude tax based on your customer's country** setting in Shopify Admin.\n\nImportant\n\nFor merchants using the US or Canadian localizations, select **Include sales tax in product price and shipping rate** in Shopify Admin. If you select this setting, you can't convert imported orders into sales documents because Business Central doesn't support backward sales tax calculation.\n\nIf you select this field and don't charge taxes, you can turn off the **VAT (Tax) Included** field in the **Shopify Order** page and proceed.\n\nTo simplify troubleshooting, you can inspect tax lines from the **Shopify Order** page.\n\nShopify Order Tax Lines page\n\nSection titled: More capabilities for filtering orders\n\n### More capabilities for filtering orders\n\nOrder synchronization now supports the **Ship-to**, **Bill-to**, and **Sell-to Countries** filters, and the **Tax Amount** filter. These filters are useful for merchants in the European Union who sell to B2B customers in other EU member states. Because of reverse charges, the order doesn't include VAT.\n\nFor more information about rules like this, see Different processing rules for orders.\n\nSection titled: Sorting in the Shopify Orders to Import page\n\n### Sorting in the Shopify Orders to Import page\n\nThe **Shopify Orders to Import** page now shows the newest orders first.\n\nShopify Orders to Import page\n\nUse this page to troubleshoot issues with order imports. You can review the available orders and take the next steps:\n\n- Check whether an error blocks the import of a specific order. Select the **Has Error** field to view error details.\n- Process only specific orders. Enter a value in the **Shop Code** field, select one or more orders, and choose the **Import Selected Orders** action.\n- Delete orders from the **Shopify Orders to Import** page to exclude them from the sync.\n\nSection titled: Deprecation of REST resources\n\n### Deprecation of REST resources\n\nShopify is moving from REST to GraphQL. In this release, Shopify deprecates endpoints for the Country and Province resources. The Shopify connector uses that information to fill the **Shopify Customer Templates** page with a list of countries where shipping is allowed. This feature still works because the Shopify connector gets this information from the shop properties.\n\nShopify can't get the list of associated provinces. The Shopify connector includes the list of provinces as setup data. Several countries require a province code to validate address information. Because Business Central doesn't enforce the use of the Country field or validate the content, the Shopify connector uses the **County Code** field in the **Shopify Shop Card** with the **Shopify Tax Area** page to get a province code when you create a customer or company in Shopify.\n\nShopify requires a state or province for the following countries:\n\n- United Arab Emirates\n- Argentina\n- Australia\n- Brazil\n- Canada\n- Chile\n- China\n- Colombia\n- Costa Rica\n- Egypt\n- Spain\n- United Kingdom\n- Guatemala\n- Hong Kong SAR\n- Indonesia\n- Ireland\n- India\n- Italy\n- Japan\n- South Korea\n- Kuwait\n- Mexico\n- Malaysia\n- Nigeria\n- Panama\n- Peru\n- Philippines\n- Portugal\n- Romania\n- Russia\n- El Salvador\n- Thailand\n- United States\n- Uruguay\n- Venezuela\n- South Africa\n\nNote\n\nGreat Britain has provinces, but you don't need to include a province in addresses.\n\nSection titled: Other improvements\n\n### Other improvements\n\nWe implemented improvements that enhance the general usability of the connector.\n\nAfter you import a Shopify order to Business Central, you can create a sales document automatically or manually. You can create a sales invoice if you fulfill the Shopify order, or a sales order if you handle fulfillment in Business Central. When you create a sales document, the document number synchronizes to Shopify as an order attribute.\n\nPeople who work with Shopify Admin find it useful to see whether orders synchronize to Business Central. In some cases, such as high-load environments, turn off synchronization. Use the new **Add Business Central Doc. No. as Attribute** toggle to control synchronization.\n\nDocument No. as Order attribute\n\nThe previous release gives you a new way to handle risk assessments. Shopify now supports two levels and external providers. The connector still imports both risk and sentiments. However, the connector didn't have a single value that represents the risk associated with an order. To fill that gap, the release adds a **High Risk** field to the **Shopify Order** and **Sync Orders from Shopify** request pages. The field is Boolean. Enable it when an order is high risk.\n\nThe **Request Data** and **Response Data** on the **Shopify Log Entry** page, and **Json Data** in the **Shopify Data Capture List** now use a rich text control that shows more information. This change makes troubleshooting simpler.\n\nThe **Create Shopify Fulfilment Service** action is now on the **Shopify Locations** page. With this action, you can create fulfillment service locations when you map locations.\n\nSection titled: Changes that are mandatory\n\n### Changes that are mandatory\n\nThe **Enable using bulk operations for Shopify connector** feature is now mandatory. You can't disable this feature. The feature affects price synchronization. With this feature, the connector synchronizes prices in bulk.\n\nYou can check the status of the synchronization on the **Shopify Bulk Operations** page.\n\nShopify Bulk Operations\n\nSection titled: Geographic areas\n\n## Geographic areas\n\nVisit the Explore Feature Geography report for Microsoft Azure areas where this feature is planned or available.\n\nSection titled: Language availability\n\n## Language availability\n\nVisit the Explore Feature Language report for information on this feature's availability.\n\nSection titled: Tell us what you think\n\n## Tell us what you think\n\nHelp us improve Dynamics 365 Business Central by discussing ideas, providing suggestions, and giving feedback.

Sixteen years after its founding, Shopify has dominated the eCommerce space and has disrupted industries beyond just retail.\n\nTo put it into perspective, Shopify powers more than 1M businesses around the world, has $17.40B in gross merchandise value making it the second-largest retailer (behind Amazon) and is now worth $96.76B.\n\nShopify’s winning strategy can be evaluated using Scott Galloway’s T-Algorithm Framework.\n\n### T-Algorithm Framework\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nI’ve organized Shopify and its competitors according to their competencies across each strategy.\n\nThe T-Algorithm framework consists of 8 strategies that define trillion-dollar firms:\n\n1. Appealing to Human Instinct\n2. Serving as a Career Accelerant\n3. Balancing Growth and Margins\n4. Rundles\n5. Vertical Integration\n6. Benjamin Button Products\n7. Visionary Storytelling\n8. Likeability\n\nTwo additional variables I feel are relevant to eCommerce business models include design and global presence.\n\n## Appealing to Human Instinct\n\nMany companies direct resources to cloud computing, virtualization, and agile methodologies believing these are the strategies that define successful firms.\n\nWhile these are all important developments, it’s difficult to grow a business that doesn’t appeal to our hardwired human instincts: _the brain, heart, gut, and genitals._\n\nThe brain refers to our desire for information (think Google’s ability to answer to all our queries), the heart is the desire for the community (Facebook allows us to connect), the gut is consumption (Amazon’ quick delivery), and genitals are our biological need to procreate (Apple’s ingenious brand loyalty).\n\nShopify’s relevant content ranks high on Google searches appealing to the brain, and the positive traits associated with its brand and entrepreneurship make it a great genitals company too.\n\n### **_Recommendations:_**\n\n- **Heart:** With over 1,000,000 businesses across 175 countries, Shopify should find ways to allow merchants to connect and create organically. Communities are difficult to build, but when done well, it creates tremendous value through network effects.\n- **The Gut:** The gut refers to our desire for consumption and getting the most value out of a dollar. Shopify is worth every penny for successful businesses, but not all stores make a sale. Starting at $29/month with only a short 2-week trial, a Shopify subscription can be hefty for young entrepreneurs. On top of its subscription plan, each app is an add-on with its own pricing. Competitors, like Woocommerce’s free open-source plugin and Wix, which starts at $13/month are more appealing to this instinct.\n- Shopify can look into creating an unlimited access subscription plan for apps. Apple implemented this strategy through the Arcade feature in its App Store. Users pay a monthly fee of 5.99 to access unlimited games.\n\n## Shopify as a Career Accelerant\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nThe ability to **attract and retain the** **best talents is a huge advantage**. The team with the best players will stay ahead of its competitors and consequently attract new talents.\n\nFirms that are career accelerants invest in their junior talent. This includes mentorship programs, learning opportunities, and meaningful networking engagements. Beyond programming, it’s important to feel challenged at work. Environments that encourage creativity, growth, and autonomy are all great signs of an accelerant.\n\n**Shopify is one of the best accelerants in this space because they have a great external brand and internal culture.** Their culture fosters learning. From the get-go, new employees are paired with a mentor, given opportunities to take on ownership, and are encouraged to “show and tell” their work. When employees exit, they can feel confident the fact that Shopify is on their resume will help them land interviews, and their learnings will help them win jobs.\n\n### _Recommendations:_\n\n- Partner with universities to attract the best graduating talent.\n- Create an “up or out” policy to encourage growth for top talent.\n- Invest in former employees by creating a Shopify Alumni network.\n\n## Growth + Margin and Recurring Revenue\n\nMost firms are either high-growth or high-margin. The flaw of this approach? Think WeWork: a case study for unchecked fervour. The company was valued at $47B based on growth, but lacked the margins to support this valuation. With only $2.6B in cash and a firey burn rate of $700M per quarter in 2019, it was a recipe for disastrous ends.\n\n**The world’s top firms have BOTH strong growth and margins.**\n\nShopify Revenues and Growth Rates\n\nShopify has demonstrated robust growth. Last year, Shopify reached over $1.5B in revenue and they’re growing about 50% year-on-year. About 40% of their revenue is recurring coming from subscription fees. The remainder comes from merchant solutions, such as payment processing fees, shipping fees, and custom store work.\n\nMore recently, Shopify’s stock exploded 140% in the last two months, making it briefly the biggest company in Canada.\n\nWhat about margins? Gross margins are expected to decline as a result of high investments in Shopify Fulfillment, a new SMB fulfillment solution over the next five years. That being said, Shopify Fulfillment is a quick punch worth taking to expand more vertically.\n\nShopify Gross Margin Progression\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- “Growth at all cost” is still the motto for many companies today, but they don’t often stop and think about the costs associated with growth.\n- There’s 3 clear ways for Shopify to increase margins: raise prices through perceived value, reduce costs in marketing/sales, cut off any limbs that aren’t profitable.\n- Overall Shopify’s margin progressions look encouraging. Even as the company grows at its scale, its margins have continually shown improvement.\n- **Communicate how margins will support Shopify’s sustained growth** to shareholders.\n\n## Vertical Integration\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nShopify has also created a POS system unifying in-store and online sales.\n\nHaving control of the distribution chain from purchase to after-sales service allows brands to have greater control over the customer experience.\n\nAreas of vertical integration for Shopify include product sourcing, fulfilment, marketing, shipping, and payment.\n\nIn the past year, Shopify acquired social shopping website Tictail, B2B wholesale purchasing platform Handshake, and AI-powered fulfillment network 6 River Systems (developed by the same team that build the core of Amazon’s robotics). The company has also acquired a marketing management chatbot Kit CRM and developed its own email marketing service. Shopify has also announced its support for Libra to build a payment network that makes payouts quicker.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Overnight delivery is a huge opportunity and a missing piece of Shopify. It’s the most attractive feature of Amazon Prime and it works. Since the launch of Amazon’s delivery service in 2018, FedEx has lost 39% in value. It’s speculated the struggling FedEx will either have to sell or merge.\n- **Merge with FedEx** — Scott Galloway predicts Walmart will acquire FedEx by 2021, but Shopify merging with FedEx would be a “gangster” move. This will allow Shopify merchants to gain the same fulfillment advantages as Amazon, without forfeiting their data and brand.\n- ShopifyEx’s combined value market cap would be $83B and create more opportunities for multiple revenue expansions.\n\n## Benjamin Button\n\nBenjamin Button products increase in value with each added customer.\n\nShopify has managed to bring in the capabilities of giants like Amazon and Walmart to small retailers. Shopify achieves its ability of economies of scale by aggregating the sales of its 1M+ businesses on its platform to provide better shipping rates, capital, and fulfillment capabilities.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- Community is King: Give entrepreneurs a playground to connect, collaborate, and concoct amazing new ventures. There are plenty of networks and Facebook groups out there, but Shopify has a home-field advantage with 1M+ users already on board.\n- Supercharged Super Store: Imagine a Shopify Super Store populated by Shopify merchants, where products are fulfilled and shipped by ShopifyEx.\n- By fostering a vibrant community for entrepreneurs, there are advantages in boosting the network effect, controlling the narrative, collecting valuable user data, and turning this community membership into another shiny cog in our rundle (recurring bundle) machine.\n\n## Visionary Storytelling\n\nVisionary storytelling is the ability to articulate a bold vision for the company to shareholders and stakeholders. The lesson used to be to underpromise and overdeliver, but now the companies with the best valuations overpromise. It gets people rowing in the same direction and attracts cheap capital.\n\nShopify is the epitome of visionary storytelling. The firm is valued at 39X its revenue and has yet to profit. The profits have been offset by their vision.\n\n**Their vision is aspirational.** Shopify makes commerce better for everyone by making it easy for entrepreneurs to start, run, and grow a business. Investors are hyped by this vision because it offers an alternative to Amazon. Though Shopify doesn’t compete directly with Amazon (smart, because Amazon competitors are DOA), they share the same eCommerce market.\n\nTo differentiate itself from Amazon, Amazon, Shopify calls its customers “merchants”. They mentioned “merchants” about 100x each earnings call, rarely mentioning customers.\n\n**Shopify shows progress to support its bold vision.** 60% of press releases in 2019 announced a new product. This includes email marketing, chat functionality, Shopify capital, and their fulfillment network. Their actions are aligned with their bold thinking.\n\nTheir press releases are also merchant-focused and the messaging around new products is centered around the benefits it provides to merchants.\n\nShopify shows and tells out loud by investing in its public relations team. There is more PR at Shopify than Amazon in terms of % of the total workforce and 74% of Shopify’s PR talent was hired in the last 2 years.\n\n## **Likeability**\n\nLikeable firms and CEOs attract more human capital and experience less government and exogenous intervention (like antitrust regulators breathing down their backs).\n\nThe founder of Shopify, Tobias Lütke, is very likeable. He started Shopify because he was dissatisfied with the existing eCommerce platforms when he tried opening his snowboarding equipment store, Snowdevil.\n\nMy personal favourite\n\nTobi made appearances on Tim Ferris’s podcast, tech conferences, and I’ve even seen him answer questions on a QA panel at my university. He tweets personably and is known to radically hire interns over Reddit. This feeds into Shopify’s own persona of leadership, innovation, and doing things differently.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- Create more internal and external leaders within the organization.\n- Invest opportunities for employees to share their work externally and become thought leaders in their industries.\n\n## **Design**\n\n_Firms that prioritize design create products/services that are more delightful, useful, and valuable to the user. An increased perceived value allows firms to increase their prices._\n\nShopify has created an amazing checkout experience. When you shop in a Shopify store, it’s recognizable for its sense of security, quickness, and clarity. It’s superior to all other checkout systems in the eCommerce space.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- Shopify has created an app called Hatchful to help merchants build brand identities easily on the phone. Shopify can create a more frictionless process for merchants to transfer their created brand to their stores. At the moment, merchants have to manually import and upload it into their stores.\n- In addition, there are opportunities for Shopify to improve the UX/UI design of its app store by improving its navigation and organization.\n- Shopify blogging and navigation back-end features for online stores still pale in comparison to Wordpress’s more advanced capabilities. For example, Shopify is still missing key features like autosaving and previewing posts before publishing.\n\n## Before you go:\n\n**Clap** 👏 👏 👏 if you enjoyed this article, so others can find it\n\n**Comment** 💬 if you have something to say\n\n**Tweet and tag** **@tobi** 🐦\n\nIf you’d ever like to collaborate on anything at all, don’t hesitate to reach out!\n\nShopify\n\nStrategy\n\nBusiness\n\nTech\n\nCase Study\n\nVivian Chow\n\nVivian Chow\n\nFollow\n\n**Written by Vivian Chow**\n\n80 followers\n\n· 62 following\n\nToronto-based marketing strategist \\| Curious about all things, but passionate about emerging tech, eCommerce and design\n\nFollow\n\n## Responses (2)\n\nWrite a response\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nCancel\n\nRespond\n\nSee all responses\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\nPrivacy \\- Terms\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\nPrivacy \\- Terms",

      "markdown": "Chat with Stripe sales\n\nShopify case study \\| Stripe\n\nShopify is an ecommerce platform powering over 1,000,000 businesses globally. Already partnering with Stripe to power its Shopify Payments offering, Shopify was looking for a way to build upon its offerings. It turned to Stripe to power its new Shopify Balance offering, allowing merchants to start, grow, and run their businesses.\n\n# Products used\n\nIssuing\n\nIssuing\n\nFinancial Accounts\n\nFinancial Accounts\n\nTerminal\n\nTerminal\n\nPayments\n\nPayments\n\nConnect\n\nConnect\n\nGlobal\n\nEnterprise\n\n## Challenge\n\nThrough testing, learning, and merchant feedback, Shopify understood that the specific money management needs of independent entrepreneurs building commerce businesses were not being met. In fact, Shopify research found that two in five merchants use their personal bank accounts and cards for business. By combining personal and business finances, it was difficult for merchants to measure the true financial health of their business. Shopify wanted to better serve the needs of these merchants by giving them access to a critical financial product to help start, run, and grow their business.\n\n## Solution\n\nShopify had already been partnering with Stripe for years to power its Shopify Payments offering, so it was natural to work with Stripe to launch this new offering, Shopify Balance. Shopify Balance would give entrepreneurs a transparent, trustworthy, and easy-to-use money management tool that is customized for the needs of commerce businesses. Using Stripe Financial Accounts for platforms, Shopify Balance was built so merchants could seamlessly manage their funds on the same platform where they run and grow their business. Shopify also leveraged Stripe Issuing so merchants could easily create, manage, and distribute virtual and physical cards to control expenses, reduce operational burden, and quickly access their Shopify balance funds with no hidden fees.\n\n## Results\n\nShopify trusted Stripe’s architecture, APIs, and speed, which eliminated complexity and helped Shopify quickly offer a financial product that allows merchants to access their funds faster without paying annual card fees, monthly account fees, or minimum balance fees, among many other benefits. It was an instant success, with more than 100,000 US small businesses opening Shopify Balance accounts in the first four months after launch.\n\n> Shopify has been doing this with Stripe for almost a decade, and we trust Stripe's DNA to always do the right thing for its customers. If you're good at building software, you think of APIs, architecture, speed, and resilience. This is what Stripe is so good at: making the complexity of money go away, being resilient, uptime, and beautiful APIs.\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\nShopify logoRead story **Shopify uses Tap to Pay on iPhone to give merchants the accessibility and convenience of accepting in-person payments with just an iPhone** \\\\\n\\\\\nShoplazza logoRead story **Shoplazza uses Stripe to power global growth with seamless cross-border payments**\n\nCreate an account and start accepting payments—no contracts or banking details required.
