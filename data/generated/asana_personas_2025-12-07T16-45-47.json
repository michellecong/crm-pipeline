    "generation_reasoning": "CRM data was not available; personas were generated from Asana's public web content (product pages, news/releases, investor updates) and industry best practices. I selected three distinct market segments: 1) Enterprise B2B SaaS product organizations in the United States because Asana emphasizes enterprise scale, product/engineering use cases (roadmaps, launches) and integrations; 2) UK mid-market Marketing Agencies because Asana highlights campaign, creative and marketing templates and strong value for creative ops; 3) US Federal public sector program/PMO buyers because Asana's roadmap, FedRAMP-in-process status, and compliance add-ons point to opportunity in regulated federal procurement. Without CRM, web content influenced location (US and UK choices), industry selection (B2B SaaS, Marketing Agencies, Public Sector), company_size_range (enterprise, mid-market, 10000+ federal scale) and job_titles (titles chosen to match how each vertical actually buys and Asana use cases). Job title lists follow seniority ordering and include common title variations for matching coverage.",
