    "generation_reasoning": "Personas were generated from Asana's public web content and industry best practices (CRM data not available). I selected five distinct company archetypes that map to Asana's product strengths: enterprise product/engineering organizations in B2B SaaS (high-value internal program coordination), US public sector (FedRAMP and AWS Marketplace opportunity), North American mid-market marketing agencies (creative ops and intake automation), global mid-market manufacturers (operations and launch coordination), and UK large healthcare providers (clinical operations and regulated workflows). Without CRM, location and industry choices came from Asana site signals (FedRAMP in process, AWS Marketplace, emphasis on enterprise and Fortune 100 customers) and market-fit analysis; company_size_range, job_titles, and decision dynamics were derived from typical buying patterns for each vertical (e.g., enterprise IT procurement timelines, agency short buying cycles). Job title sets reflect the functional buyers and include title variations/levels per the provided master list. Tiers were balanced to reflect where Asana’s product and go-to-market are likely highest value and most accessible: two tier_1 opportunities (enterprise tech and public sector), two tier_2 (marketing agencies and manufacturing), and one tier_3 (healthcare) as opportunistic given regulatory complexity.",
