Tiers are balanced: two tier_1 (40%), two tier_2 (40%), one tier_3 (20%) to match strategic priority and opportunity density. Each persona uses a single industry, a standard company_size_range, 10–27 decision-maker title variations ordered by seniority, and descriptions that explicitly state team size, deal size, sales cycle, and stakeholder counts along with decision drivers and engagement approach.",
