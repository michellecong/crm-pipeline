Five personas cover US small local services (rapid self-serve adoption), US mid-market B2B SaaS (core high-fit segment with predictable ARR and pilots), Global enterprise software (large integrated buys needing data/governance and long cycles), UK mid-market retail (commerce-focused buyers with localized payments needs), and US large healthcare (specialized RCM buyers with compliance/integration needs). Tier allocation balances opportunity: two tier_1 (highest ACV & strategic fit), two tier_2 (high volume/scale potential), and one tier_3 (more specialized/opportunistic). Each persona includes 10-30+ industry-appropriate titles ordered by seniority, a single industry, a standard company_size_range, a focused location level, and a 3-5 sentence description that explicitly states team size, deal size, sales cycle, and stakeholder count plus decision/process cues and engagement approaches.",
