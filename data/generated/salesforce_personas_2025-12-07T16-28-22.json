    "generation_reasoning": "I selected three personas to cover Salesforce's strongest product fits and address distinct buying patterns: (1) US Enterprise Financial Services - Revenue Leaders for Sales Cloud, Revenue Intelligence and integrations in large regulated buyers; (2) UK Mid-Market Retail - Marketing Leaders for Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Data Cloud in growth-oriented retailers; (3) DACH Large Manufacturing - Operations Leaders for Field Service, IoT Cloud and MuleSoft integrations in industrial buyers. CRM customer data was not provided, so personas were generated from the seller's public product catalog, Salesforce web content, and industry best practices. Without CRM data I used product-to-industry mapping, typical buying roles and enterprise procurement behaviours to set location, company_size_range, job_titles, and fit—e.g., enterprise Financial Services assigned longer sales cycles and larger deal sizes; UK retail assigned marketing lead roles and shorter procurement timelines; DACH manufacturing assigned operations/field-service roles and requirement for ERP integration.",
