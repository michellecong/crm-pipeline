I created five distinct company archetypes covering geography, size, industry and function diversity: two Tier 1 (highest fit / highest deal potential), two Tier 2 (solid-fit, faster cycles or mid-market volume) and one Tier 3 (opportunistic, long procurement). Each persona uses one industry only, includes 10–30+ senior buyer titles ordered by seniority, 3–10+ excluded titles to filter poor fits, standard company size ranges, and descriptions with all required quantitative metrics (team size, deal size, sales cycle, stakeholder count) plus decision-process and recommended engagement approach. Tier distribution was balanced to meet the required proportions (tier_1:2/5 ≈ 40%, tier_2:2/5 ≈ 40%, tier_3:1/5 = 20%).",
