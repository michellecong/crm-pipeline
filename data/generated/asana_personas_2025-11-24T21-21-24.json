    "generation_reasoning": "CRM data was not available; personas were generated from Asana's public product and news content and industry best practices. I selected five buyer-company archetypes that map to Asana's product strengths (work management, portfolios/goals, workflows, integrations, AI, and enterprise permissions): 1) United States Enterprise B2B SaaS Revenue Leaders — fits Asana's enterprise GTM and large-scale revenue org use cases; 2) Global Mid-Market Marketing Agencies Campaign Leads — aligns to Asana for Marketing/templates and campaign orchestration; 3) United Kingdom Large Financial Services Ops Leaders — targets regulated, integration-heavy buyers who need compliance and reporting; 4) DACH Healthcare Systems Administrative Leaders — targets regulated public-sector/healthcare workflows where compliance and revenue-cycle integration matter; 5) North America Mid-Market Retail & Ecom Marketing Leads — focuses on seasonal campaigns, commerce integrations and marketing ops. Web content (product pages, what's-new releases, investor news) influenced persona fields: product emphasis on AI Workflows and Compliance informed selection of enterprise and regulated segments; integrations list (Salesforce, Tableau, Okta, AWS Marketplace) drove emphasis on buyers requiring deep integrations; FedRAMP and compliance messaging informed the Healthcare and Public/Regulated persona selections; Asana's listed customer examples and marketing messaging guided company_type, likely buyer functions and the recommended engagement approaches. Job titles and decision-making patterns were chosen based on the industry→function mappings and seniority patterns in the master job-title guidance. Company_size_range and location choices reflect typical buyer profiles and Asana's public positioning (enterprise readiness and broad global coverage).",
