      "processed_markdown": "Content Item 1 (website) - https://stripe.com/:\n1. Company Basic Information\n- Mission/vision: “Make moving money as simple, borderless, and programmatic as the rest of the internet.” Focus on growing customers’ revenue and embedding financial services.\n- Main products/services: Payments, Billing, Checkout, Connect, Radar (fraud), Terminal (in‑person), Treasury, Issuing, Capital, Tax, Identity, Invoicing, Sigma (analytics), Elements, Atlas, Climate, Payment Links, Payouts, Refunds, Apps & App Marketplace, Professional Services.\n- Business model: Platform/transactional + SaaS (product tiers and enterprise contracts). Integrated per-transaction pricing; developer-first APIs and low/no-code solutions; professional services/partners for enterprise integrations.\n\n2. Personnel Information\n- No executive roster on the homepage. Decision-maker signals: developer-focused product owners, sales (contact sales), and professional services indicated; “Chat with Stripe sales” CTA for procurement/engagement. (Executives not listed on this page.)\n\n3. Business Information\n- Partners/customers: logos/mentions (OpenAI, Amazon, Google, Anthropic, Shopify, Airbnb, Marriott, BMW, Twilio, Atlassian, Lyft, Instacart, Postmates, Stripe App Marketplace integrations such as Salesforce & SAP).\n- Scale indicators: “process hundreds of billions of dollars each year”; API requests peak ~13k/sec; high historical uptime claims; supports many currencies/payment methods.\n- Market position: Positioned as a global, end-to-end payments and financial infrastructure leader for startups through enterprises.\n\n4. Technology Direction\n- Developer- and API-first platform with SDKs/libraries across major languages and mobile.\n- Emphasis on AI-powered features (fraud detection, revenue ops automation) and programmable finance (Treasury, Issuing, Capital).\n- Low-/no-code flows (Payment Links, Checkout) for rapid deployment.\n- Integration ecosystem (App Marketplace, 100+ third-party integrations).\n\n5. Pain Points and Challenges (implied)\n- Complexity of global payments (gateways, rails, local methods, tax/accounting).\n- Need to maintain extremely high uptime and authorization rates.\n- Balancing feature breadth (payments + banking + cards + tax + identity) while keeping APIs simple and performant.\n- Fraud prevention and conversion optimization across regions.\n\n6. Business Needs\n- Continue global product localization (local payment methods, currencies, taxes).\n- Improve authorization rates / reduce fraud (conversion uplift = value prop).\n- Scale professional services & partner integrations to support enterprise deployments.\n- Cost and operational efficiency to support competitive per-transaction pricing.\n\n7. Development Changes\n- Broad product expansion into treasury, issuing, lending (Capital), embedded components, and climate/CSR offerings.\n- Increasing emphasis on bundled revenue operations (billing, tax, RevRec) beyond core payments.\n\n8. Policy Impact\n- Homepage implies compliance needs for global operations (KYC, tax, region-specific payment rules) but no explicit policy text.\n\n9. Competitive Landscape\n- Competes with payment gateways/PSPs, billing platforms, and embedded finance providers. Competitive advantages: developer experience, unified stack, global footprint, rich partner ecosystem.\n- Threats: vertical specialists (billing, bank partners), regional payment processors, major incumbents (PayPal, Adyen, Stripe-like offerings from banks).\n\n10. Success Cases\n- Customer highlights: BMW, Amazon, Maersk, Twilio, OpenAI, Atlassian, Instacart, Shopify, Lyft, Postmates, Substack, Slack, Zapier with concrete claims (e.g., Twilio +10% auth rate; Zapier +4% auth = ~$3M revenue).\n\n11. Budget and Procurement\n- CTA paths: “Create an account instantly” or “Contact sales” for custom packages; offers no-contract per-transaction pricing and standard online signup for SMBs; enterprise procurement implied via sales/PS engagements.\n\n12. Digital Transformation\n- Stripe positions as an enabler of digital transformation (embed payments and financial services into products); core needs: system integration, APIs, SDK upgrades, partner app deployments.\n\n13. Industry Regulation\n- Implied heavy regulatory scope (global payments, taxes, identity verification, card networks) requiring KYC, tax registration, and compliance across jurisdictions.\n\n14. Market Opportunities\n- Expand embedded finance (Treasury, Issuing, Capital), global expansion/local payment method support, AI-enabled revenue operations, marketplaces/platforms, and enterprise billing/tax automation.\n\n— — —",

      "markdown": "forbes-f\n\nStripe’s IPO Potential Is Stronger Than Ever\n\nBy Daniel Webber\n\nFollow Author\n\nMoneyFintech\n\n# Stripe’s IPO Potential Is Stronger Than Ever\n\nBy Daniel Webber,\n\nContributor.\n\nForbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.\nI write about international payments.\n\nFollow Author\n\nSep 23, 2025, 08:45am EDT\n\nShare\n\nSaveComment0\n\nPatrick Collison, Co-Founder and CEO of Stripe, during a House hearing on stablecoins\n\nPatrick Collison, Co-Founder and CEO of Stripe, testifying before the House Financial Service Committee hearing in March of this year on the potential of stablecoins for the payments industry. The rise of stablecoins has helped put Stripe into an increasingly strong position in terms of an IPO.... More\n\nGetty Images\n\nLast week, Stripe Payments International Holdings, the Dublin, Ireland-based international subsidiary of payments heavyweight Stripe, published its annual financial results for 2024.\n\nA mandatory requirement for Ireland-based companies, the annual figures provide the only view into Stripe’s financial performance outside of the annual letter penned by company’s co-founders, CEO Patrick Collison and President John Collison. But while that letter provides an operational narrative and an annual update on the money moved through Stripe each year, the International results provide hard figures on revenue, profitability and expenditure for a subsidiary that accounts for around a quarter of the company’s global employees.\n\nHowever, this year, those numbers included something not seen at Stripe International for half a decade: profit. Alongside revenue growth of 34% to $5.1bn for 2024, the subsidiary also reported $102m in pre-tax profit – a significant improvement on the previous year’s losses of $1.2bn.\n\nThis is helping to cement Stripe’s position as an increasingly strong candidate for an IPO after years of anticipation from investors and industry commentators alike. Having raised $9.4bn since its founding 15 years ago, from players including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global, Stripe has faced pressure to make the move to the public markets for some time. But it may be in a stronger position to do so now than has been the case in some time.\n\nPROMOTED\n\n## Stripe’s shift to profit is a strong sign for an IPO\n\nThis shift to profit may be a single year in a subsidiary, but it echoes statements in the Collisons’ annual letter, where they reported that the company “was profitable in 2024” and that they expected it “to be so in 2025 and beyond”.\n\nFurther analysis of the Stripe International numbers shows a strong focus on increasing operational efficiencies, with costs per employee dropping and costs being kept broadly flat. This all speaks to a greater focus on the type of financial maturity that might be expected from a company readying itself for an IPO – and is likely to please investors who are looking for a company of Stripe’s reach and renown to have a strong base on which to build.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### Full Moon November 2025: When To See The Biggest Supermoon Since 2019\n\n### The Top 10 Richest People In The World \\| November 2025\n\n### The 5 Best Water Flossers Worth Buying, Based On Our Testing\n\nNotably, the fact that the company has opted to make this move to profitability now also suggests an intention to refine its financials to a more market-ready position. In the past, it is very likely that the company could have switched to profitability earlier at the expense of R&D development, and the fact it has made this choice now speaks not only to its general maturity as a company, but also to a sense that the end of its time as a private company may be in sight.\n\n## Lessons from Circle: Stablecoins and market demand\n\nBeyond the numbers, there are also signs that the market is in a very different place now than it was even at the beginning of the year. Circle’s blockbuster IPO surprised many in the industry and at the time of writing, around three months on, the company is trading roughly 26% up on its market debut.\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\nPrivacy \\- Terms\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\nPrivacy \\- Terms\n\nForbes Daily: Join over 1 million Forbes Daily subscribers and get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.\n\nEmail Address\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates’ offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.

Enjoy the Daily!\n\nMore Newsletters\n\nThis speaks to a renewed market enthusiasm for fintechs such as Stripe, and it is quite likely that the payments giant could see an even stronger market debut if it makes its move in similarly favorable conditions. While Circle’s domain is exclusively stablecoins, Stripe’s is the whole internet, with a payment volume that it says is roughly equivalent to around 1.3% of global GDP.\n\nThat’s not to say that Stripe’s stablecoin presence won’t also be a help to it. Having bought stablecoin infrastructure player Bridge at the start of the year for $1.1bn, the company has cemented itself as a key player in the fast-emerging market, as well as in the fiat-led payments space – and that is likely to make it even more appealing to investors looking for companies that can proxy for the wider stablecoin market.\n\n## Can Stripe reach a $100bn valuation?\n\nStripe’s most recent valuation came in February of this year, when the company was priced at $91.5bn. However, its highest valuation was in 2021, when the company saw its value reach $95bn, although this dropped to $74bn the following year amid a wider post-pandemic slump.\n\nThe most recent valuation came as part of an employee share sale, a move widely considered to be a sign that an IPO was not imminent. However, that valuation and its reported improvements in fiscal maturity since speak to a company that is improving its offering to the market – and Circle’s IPO is likely to have created a new benchmark for valuations that Stripe compares favourably to.\n\n$100bn may therefore not only be in reach for the company, but a crucial point its leadership is looking to reach for in order to pull the trigger on its long-awaited IPO. And if that is the case, it may well yet see that within the year.\n\nWhile 2026 is by no means a guarantee for a Stripe IPO, its current moves make it more likely than ever – assuming the current market conditions hold.\n\nEditorial Standards Reprints & Permissions\n\nDaniel Webber\n\nFind Daniel Webber on LinkedIn.

The brothers were writing code and brainstorming product ideas before doubling down on payments in 2011—ultimately building a company now valued at $70 billion.\n\nFifteen years later, one of those early ideas is stepping into the spotlight, providing what Stripe has come to see as a new pillar to its business.\n\nStripe Billing, for years a slept-on prototype at the San Francisco company, has become the engine of Stripe’s Revenue and Finance Automation suite. At the end of January, the group crossed $500 million in annual revenue run rate. Though the Collison brothers wrote the first iteration of a billing product before Stripe launched, Stripe Billing didn’t come to market until 2018.\n\n“It was something we underestimated for a very long time,” said John Collison, Stripe cofounder and president. “I think it's only recently that we started viewing it as the main second business.”\n\nWith customers like Atlassian, OpenAI, Anthropic, and AMC Networks, Stripe Billing essentially handles a company’s recurring payments and usage-based services like pay-as-you-go cloud-based software. (If you’ve paid for an AMC+ subscription to watch _The Walking Dead_, you’ve used Stripe Billing.) It’s a notably different market and technology than the bread-and-butter online payments Stripe processes. Stripe Billing’s rise means the company has new competitors in a fundamentally different business—and potential to embed even more deeply into large enterprises and fast-growing AI startups.\n\nFor Stripe, one of Silicon Valley’s most scrutinized private companies and long-stalked by IPO watchers, the growth of the billing business clearly represents a key puzzle piece to the company’s future. (Collison affirmed the company’s commitment to building a strong business when asked about plans for going public.)\n\nAfter years of growing quietly, Stripe thinks the time has come for billing to find its light. Stripe billboards have been springing up across the country in what Stripe CMO Jeff Titterton described in a statement as “our biggest brand marketing push yet.” The campaign has featured high-profile customers and, Titterton added, over time has “expanded to put Billing center stage.”\n\n## **An invisible internet giant**\n\nIn some sense, Stripe is paradoxical—an invisible giant, simultaneously everywhere, though you probably don’t notice it.\n\nIf you’ve bought crewnecks from Amazon, curtains from Wayfair, or shoes from H&M, your payment was processed through Stripe. If you’ve ordered pizza from Postmates, gotten groceries on Instacart, or booked an Airbnb—all those payments were processed through Stripe.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn 2023, Stripe surpassed $1 trillion in total payment volume, serving millions of businesses, from Fortune 500 companies to startups and small businesses. The years since the pandemic have been a bit of a roller coaster: In March 2021, the company hit a $95 billion valuation, which slid in the post-pandemic slowdown.\n\nStripe declined comment on its financials and directed _Fortune_ to its 2023 annual letter, which stated that Stripe was cash-flow-positive in 2023 and expected to be again in 2024.\n\nDespite the fluctuations, Stripe remains high on Silicon Valley’s mountain of unicorns, and the company’s core business remains intrinsic to the modern internet economy. As the internet has evolved, billing has also become an increasingly important part of the digital economy—and an area in which Stripe sees opportunities. Sharmeen Browarek Chapp, Stripe’s head of product for the Revenue and Financial Automation business, believes that billing today is where online payments were ten years ago. “We're at the same inflection point,” she said.\n\nHandling different types of payments, such as pay-as-you-go, is an increasingly critical feature for companies today, said Chapp. “If businesses can't stay up to speed, it holds them back.”\n\nAnd though they’re both, well, money-related, billing and payments are different.\n\n“There's a whole different side of accounting that you have to deal with,” said Tara Seshan, former head of product for Stripe Billing. “Payments are often in the cash-based accounting world. Billing is often the interface between your real revenue accounting, your accrual-based accounting world and your cash-based world. So, you're having to think about a whole bunch of complexities... It's a huge headache. There's a lot of edge cases, and it's why businesses shouldn't build their own.”\n\nThat’s not to say they have nothing in common. Billing and payments both, for example, hinge on trust. (Stripe said that, during Black Friday and Cyber Monday in 2024, its API maintained an uptime of more than 99.9999%. That means you’re more likely to get struck by lightning than hit Stripe downtime.) But billing’s demands are ultimately very specific.\n\n“At the end of the day, billing is more of a software play,” said Jordan McKee, global director of S&P’s Fintech Research and Advisory Group. “You’ve got to have a lot of capabilities at play to collect revenue from your customers on a recurring basis. You need to be able to support different pricing models and code that in, whether it's recurring billing, usage-based, or tiered.\"\n\n## **Billing’s complexities**\n\nCollison is upfront about how tricky billing can get.\n\nHere’s an example, Collison says: If we sit down and start a telephone company, how hard can managing pricing be? It starts out simple with, say, $20 monthly individual plans. But over time, you have the complexities that come with family plans, customers joining mid-month, and international travel.\n\n“Suddenly, we have an extremely complex engineering problem that comes from making very reasonable business choices,” he said.\n\nIn short, billing can become a labyrinth, built up over time in a way that’s interconnected and sometimes intractable.\n\n“It’s very easy for things to quickly get complex,” Collison said. “It’s sort of like orbital mechanics, where everything has an effect. ‘We just want the rocket to go to the moon. How hard can it be?’ Well, you’ve got to take into account gravity, and so on.”\n\nIn the early days of Stripe Billing, the project was less _Mission Control_ and more _30 Rock_.\n\n“I often describe how working on Stripe Billing was like working at SNL, in the sense that everyone is having nightmares every week, trying to get the show on the road and ship this feature,” said Seshan, who was leading Stripe Billing from 2017 to 2019. “It all felt like improv a bunch of times.”\n\nOne especially harried day, Seshan and the billing team printed out a deluge of launch and integration documents, pasting them all over a conference room.\n\n\"We were rewriting the examples on a whiteboard,” said Seshan. “I hadn't showered in three days, neither had anyone else. It was very SNL: A guy on our team had come to give us a pizza. He opened the door and was like: ‘It smells terrible in here!’\"\n\nStripe Billing has come a long way since, especially in the last three years, as the product has found a notable home among fast-growing AI startups, from OpenAI and Anthropic to Perplexity and MidJourney. ( _Fortune_ has a business partnership with Perplexity.) For MidJourney—known as a leader in generative AI images—Stripe Billing has been essential, said MidJourney CFO Nadia Ali. In 2023, she says, MidJourney’s $200 million in ARR ran through Stripe Billing.\n\n\"The floodgates just opened,” Ali told _Fortune_. “We really weren't expecting that amount of interest at all. Because we were using Stripe, it allowed us to really be able to scale quickly in terms of our accounting, for example, where we use Stripe for revenue recognition, all our tax reporting. That made a huge difference in how my team is structured right now—we’re able to stay very, very lean.”\n\nMidJourney uses usage-based billing (a concept Stripe demos in an online spaghetti-eating game). It’s a capability essential for an AI company at a time in the boom where there’s a lot of angst about what it takes to stay soaring as a high-flying AI startup.\n\n“We hear from our users all the time that it can take up to six months for them to make a small change in their billing,” said Stripe’s Chapp. “Think about these AI companies and how much they've grown in the last two years: If every change they made took six months, they wouldn’t exist.\"\n\nThat’s not to say only AI startups need billing help. Collison has been struck by the extent to which billing has attracted interest up and down the corporate food chain. (Atlassian, whose market cap comes in around $82 billion, uses Stripe Billing across all its products.)\n\n“A decade ago, people would have said Stripe’s really popular with startups, and part of what it does is for developers, helping them get to market faster,” Collison told _Fortune_. “That’s where we got our start, the intuitive sense that this was something very helpful for startups. But we didn’t really have a view of all these more established companies. I think what emerged—and it was striking—is that almost all large enterprises are dissatisfied with their current billing.”\n\n## **Stripe’s future**\n\nStripe faces a number of billing competitors, said S&P Global’s McKee, who cited Zuora, Chargebee, and Recurly. Adyen is also in the mix, even though Stripe still has an edge with earlier stage companies.\n\n\"If I were a competitor, I might try to throw some shade on Stripe for having its hands in too many things, for maybe not being as focused or as dedicated to billing as another company,” said McKee. But he credits Stripe for making the product incredibly approachable: “You don't have to be an engineer or an expert coder to bring this thing to life.”\n\nStripe’s broad marketing push around billing is similarly sleek and approachable. One monochromatic purple-tinted billboard shows _The Walking Dead_ on a TV set, zombies breaking through the windows behind it. In a zombie play-on-words, it reads: “AMC+ makes subscriptions with Stripe a no-brainer.”\n\nTo McKee, the big question is this: How big can billing really get? \"Does it ever make sense to actually spin this out, and it becomes an independent company still with like these arms-length agreements with Stripe,” he wonders.\n\nTime will tell, but one distinctly possible scenario could see Stripe Billing following a path similar to Amazon’s AWS cloud business — a stalwart giant in its own right, linked to something even more expansive. It’s been a runaway success for Amazon, whose share price and profit have surged in the years since the retailer launched its cloud business.\n\nCollison isn’t letting on whether billing is part of the gateway to a possible IPO, but he’s clear that billing is a place where Stripe’s looking to the future. “We very much like the idea of tracking profitable and self-funding it, so we’re not subject to the whims of one year,” he said. “We have our ten-year roadmap for billing, and we’re going out and executing regardless of what anyone thinks.”\n\nOver the coming months and years, it’ll be easy to forget that billing began as an experiment, started before Stripe as we know it even existed. But perhaps answers to Stripe’s much-anticipated future lie in its past—like Stripe itself, hidden in plain sight, just waiting to come into focus.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView Comments\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\n\nYour Privacy Choices \n\nMore Info",

But who is number two? In March of 2021, Stripe raised a $600M Series H round that secured its status as the second-most valuable private company in the United States, with a jaw-dropping 95 billion dollar valuation… and here’s the thing: people are saying it’s undervalued. Here’s my attempt to bundle up how two brothers from rural Ireland have built Silicon Valley’s latest fairytale, what Stripe does, and how it’s on track to change the world — or at least how we pay for things.\n\nFlash back to 2005, when sixteen year old Patrick Collison receives Ireland’s young scientist of the year award for creating a new dialect in the LISP programming language. A year later he graduates high school early, heads to Boston, and enrolls in MIT. Meanwhile, Patrick’s younger brother John gets the highest score in history on Ireland’s nation-wide high school examination (take a wild guess whose record he broke), just before enrolling at Harvard in the class of 2009. As in every good super-fast-growth tech tale, our protagonists drop out of their respective institutions pretty quickly. The Collisons trade cap and gown to pursue an idea: they intend to change the way money moves through the internet.\n\nIn 2010, when Patrick and John Collison founded Stripe, ecommerce was well established and innovating quickly. At the start of the new decade eBay became available on the iPad, Amazon was expanding internationally, and a fast-growing, venture backed disruptor called Shopify was paving the way for a new generation of online sellers. The financial technology that underlay these platforms, however, was comparatively archaic. At the time, PayPal was the alpha player. Founded over ten years ago by the legendary trio of Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Max Levchin, PayPal made it ten times easier to transfer money online. They served as the middleman between online merchants, consumers, banks, and credit card companies, organizing the flow of information and dollars in a fast and secure way. A lot had changed since PayPal’s founding in 1998, though, and the tech didn’t keep pace. Enter Patrick and John Collison, who had a vision for a better payment infrastructure with an easy setup process that worked everywhere, every time.\n\nSo to understand _what Stripe does_ you need to first understand two entities: A payment gateway and a payment service provider (PSP). Payment gateways are where you go to input your card information. They can either exist virtually– where you type in your credit card info after hitting ‘buy now’, or take a physical form– the small point-of-sale (POS) card readers in every mom and pop. After customers have submitted their card information either virtually or online, it enters the world of the PSP. With every credit card transaction, information and currency go through five sets of hands: those of the consumer, the merchant, the merchant’s bank (known as the acquiring bank), the credit card company, and the consumer’s bank (known as the issuing bank). With a debit card this process is similar but simplified. Payment service providers live in the space between the merchant and the merchant’s bank, _providing_ the _service_ of ensuring that the information of a _payment_ is legit (the consumer has the money to pay up), and guaranteeing that the cash actually ends up in the merchant’s account. In exchange for this, PSPs take a very small slice of the pie.\n\nBefore PSPs, merchants were required to deal directly with their acquiring bank through a merchant account. The merchant account was located on the servers of an acquiring bank, processed the credit card information and money from buyers, and transferred the revenue to the merchant’s bank account. Good in theory, but not something for the impatient in practice! Setting up a merchant account was no easy feat. Between making sure regulations were met, validating that compliance was fulfilled, establishing relationships with card companies, paying dizzying fees, and tolerating weeks of delay all while assuming complete risk of any card fraud, the process was a nightmare. Every business accepting card payments dealt with this issue– until the tech boom at the end of the 1990s.\n\nPayPal burst onto the scene in 1998 as the first major PSP. It enabled businesses to easily set up an account and immediately begin accepting payments of all kinds– from credit cards to debit cards to ACH payments and more. The company grew quickly and went public, eventually becoming the industry’s dominant player with the lion’s share of the market in 2010. Despite being the widely accepted standard in the payment industry, the Collison brothers saw a lot of room for improvement in PayPal. A new generation of software companies were coming of age, and PayPal’s tech did not meet their needs.\n\nNow-behemoths Zoom, Lyft, and Blue Apron were all founded in 2010. They and millions of other software-driven businesses required a PSP that accepted all types of payment, could be set up quickly, and, critically, could integrate into their software platform with ease. The technical term for what these future unicorns needed was simpler API integration. This essentially meant they wanted to purchase code that solved all their annoying payment problems and could be shaped to work seamlessly with their websites and products. Highly effective and easy to integrate– the perfect payment infrastructure.\n\nStripe rose to the challenge with its first product. _Simple_ was an API that consisted of seven lines of code that, when copied and pasted, allowed businesses to immediately start accepting one-off payments. In the fintech world, these seven lines offered an inkling of the simple, yet powerful functionality Stripe promised to provide in the future. From 2011 to 2018 the company expanded rapidly. Stripe launched a host of new products that offered targeted solutions for all different types of software businesses. _Connect_ provided a payment API for platform businesses that connect buyers to sellers, like AirBnB; _Billing_ enabled subscription models like newsletters to monetize; _Stripe Issuing_ empowered schemes that required virtual cards, like DoorDash and UberEats; and _Stripe Payouts_ brought payment service to online freelancers. The company’s valuation reflected its explosive growth: Silicon Valley’s most esteemed investors cut larger and larger checks every other year as the valuation climbed from $100M in 2012 to $3.5B in 2014 to $36B in April of 2020. By this time Stripe was processing billions of dollars from millions of businesses all over the world through their APIs and taking a 2.9% + 30¢ fee every time. They did so in silence, without loud marketing campaigns or in-your-face paid Google advertisements. The overwhelming excellence of the product spoke for itself. And so while everyone in San Francisco and some in New York was aware of what the Collison brothers were accomplishing, the other hundreds of millions of Americans went through daily life completely ignorant about their dependence on what couple brilliant siblings from the Irish countryside had built.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n_Patrick Collison (front), John Collison (back)_\n\nOne key to Stripe’s growth was its focus on selling the product to software engineers, rather than the finance people in companies. Software businesses were the future and engineers were individuals building it. Stripe’s products made engineers’ lives easier, allowing them to rest assured payment would happen seamlessly and focus on creating products. This separated Stripe from some of its competitors like Square, Toast, and Adyen, many of whom focused more on brick-and-mortar integration and marketed to CFO types.\n\nThe primary improvement Stripe offers over PayPal continues to be easier API integration. A close second, though, is in the category of data portability. Merchants using PayPal don’t have a lot of agency over the data they gather. Terabytes of very valuable information sit on PayPal’s servers, including credit card information, customer name, and payment history. If a merchant wants to switch PSPs, PayPal has the notorious habit of freezing accounts and obstructing the process. They don’t want to let their customers leave. Stripe, on the other hand, makes a point to emphasize complete data portability which instills a level of trust and signals a commitment to quality service. Combine this with zero set up costs, no monthly fees, and nullified fraud risk, and you quickly end up with a no-brainer decision for merchants choosing a payment infrastructure. Millions of merchants made the easy decision. By early 2020 Stripe’s product, team, and strategy produced a $35B business, but it was crucial timing that would ignite tremendous revenue growth and send the valuation into the stratosphere.\n\nThe onset of the pandemic in the spring of 2020 and the lockdowns that ensued spurred a huge uptick in ecommerce and SaaS (Software as a Service) activity. Zoom, a Stripe customer, saw a 2000% increase in daily participants, while Instacart and Slack posted 300% and 80% jumps in demand, respectively. Online penetration of retail sales doubled during the pandemic, growing from 16% to 34%, as ecommerce became increasingly necessary. The diversity and robustness of Stripe’s products were fit for the challenge of increased volume. To make matters better, Stripe’s growth coincided with comparatively poor performances from some of its competitors. Square, which has a large presence in Brick-and-Mortar establishments, saw a decline in Q2 2020 revenue as in-person shopping ceased. Similarly, Toast, which offers POS and PSP solutions for the restaurant industry, saw huge drops in revenue as restaurants closed across the world. Venture capitalists licked their lips at Stripe’s numbers; Sequoia Capital led an oversubscribed series H in Q1 2021 that valued Stripe at $95B.\n\nSince around 2012, Stripe has also been expanding a host of other products. In line with its goal of “increasing the GDP of the internet”, these offerings add on to their fast and easy payment solutions by protecting card information from fraud, providing businesses credit and debt products priced using in-house data, and analytics powered by Stripe’s growing database of information on companies. In addition, Stripe has released a platform called _Stripe Atlas_ which helps businesses from all around the world incorporate in the US. Stripe’s customer list features names like Google and Amazon, yet they still drive innovations that enable entrepreneurs from developing countries to get a foothold and grow. The last dozen years have seen groundbreaking developments in the way we move, eat, talk, learn, and play. Stripe sits at the nexus, letting us do it all more easily.\n\n> “Our strategy is very deliberately to serve both ends of the continuum (startups and enterprises), and every point in between. This ensures we can provide the most powerful functionality to the youngest companies in the world, and that we can provide the most forward-thinking technology to the largest and most established.”\n>\n> **Patrick Collison on Stripe’s Direction, 2019**\n\nDespite the tremendous strides Stripe has made since its humble beginnings in 2010, the future is characterized by some uncertainty. New players constantly seek to enter the payments game, making the space notoriously low-margin. Stripe is the best of the best for online payment solutions, but now that it has paved the path to success many other smaller competitors will seek to emulate it. On top of this, PayPal isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Despite having an inferior product, the firm has maintained its dominance through executing strategic acquisitions of new players like Braintree and putting in place high switching costs for merchants. PayPal continues to control around 50% of the market, servicing around 460k websites compared to Stripe’s 160k.\n\nEven still, almost all signs point Stripe to the moon! With only 34% of US retail sales occurring online, the potential for Stripe to grow even more as a payment solution for the internet economy is tremendous. Nearly 80% of US internet users have purchased something through a Stripe-powered business, and there is no indication that this figure is going anywhere but up. Stripe is the gold standard for startups– unearthing an elegant solution to a universally crucial problem and continuing to innovate feverishly even in the face of success that would force most of us into complacency. Behind it all are two ingenious brothers with a little idea of how to better transfer bits and dollars through the internet.\n\nHopefully this article will open your eyes to what Stripe has done and where it’s undoubtedly bound. And next time SpaceX sends a rocket into orbit, spare a thought for the brothers who probably helped pay for it.\n\nSpecial thanks to Sam Harshe for his help throughout the editing process.\n\nFor similar content follow my **twitter**!\n\nFintech\n\nPayments\n\nStartup\n\nTechnology\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nJeremy Haddock\n\nJeremy Haddock\n\nFollow\n\n**Written by Jeremy Haddock**\n\n14 followers\n\n· 15 following\n\nLife-long learner writing about startups in my free time!
