    "generation_reasoning": "Three personas were selected to cover Oracle's primary go-to-market motions: 1) large regulated enterprises buying infrastructure, database, and security (Financial Services IT leaders), 2) high-volume global mid-market SaaS companies buying revenue stack and CX/CPQ solutions (B2B SaaS revenue leaders), and 3) EMEA manufacturers focused on supply chain and ERP modernization (Operations leaders). CRM data was not available; therefore personas were generated from Oracle web content (product catalog, cloud/AI positioning, use cases) and industry best practices. Web content and product focus (OCI, Exadata, Autonomous DB, ERP, SCM, CX, CPQ) directly influenced persona selection, the choice of industries, and which functions to target. Company_size_range and location choices reflect typical buyer profiles for each product line (enterprise Financial Services for Exadata/OCI; mid-market SaaS for CX/CPQ/NetSuite; EMEA manufacturing for SCM/ERP/IoT). Job title lists follow industry purchasing models and the master title patterns (C-level → VP → Director → Manager), while excluded titles remove roles unlikely to hold budget or influence procurement for these products.",
