I balanced tiers across opportunity: two tier_1 (high fit, larger deal sizes and accessible enterprise/mid‑market buyers), two tier_2 (solid fit with moderate complexity), and one tier_3 (opportunistic regional segment). Each persona is differentiated by at least two dimensions (industry, geography, company size, or primary function). Titles follow the provided master patterns and include all title variations and seniority ordering. Descriptions include the required quantitative metrics (team size, deal size, sales cycle, stakeholder count) and a concise decision process, strategic product fit, and recommended engagement approach for Stripe's products.",
