    "generation_reasoning": "I generated three distinct company archetypes tailored to Asana's product strengths and market signals from Asana's web content and public news. Chosen personas: 1) United States Enterprise B2B SaaS - Product Leaders (high-value, strategic enterprise product and product-ops buyers), 2) UK Mid-Market Digital Marketing - Campaign Leaders (mid-market marketing teams and agencies suited to Asana for Marketing), and 3) United States Large Government Agencies - IT Leaders (opportunistic public-sector buyers enabled by FedRAMP and marketplace distribution). CRM data was not available, so personas were created from Asana's official website, product pages, release notes, investor news, and industry best practices. Web content influenced location (FedRAMP and AWS Marketplace suggested a US public-sector focus), industry selection (Asana use cases for Marketing, Product, Operations), company_size_range (enterprise signals from Fortune 100 claims and enterprise add-ons drove larger ranges), and job_titles (product, marketing, and public-sector IT seniorities were derived from target roles referenced across product pages, case studies, and release notes). Job title lists follow the master patterns for seniority and buying functions appropriate to each vertical.",
