I selected five personas to cover the highest-volume & highest-fit segments: two tier_1 (best opportunities), two tier_2 (solid opportunities) and one tier_3 (opportunistic), giving a balanced distribution (tier_1 40%, tier_2 40%, tier_3 20%). Each persona isolates a single industry, appropriate company size range, and geographic focus aligned with common HubSpot customer concentrations (US, UK, DACH, ANZ). Job title lists follow the master patterns (seniority ordered C-level → VP → Director → Manager) and excluded titles remove common false positives. Descriptions include the required quantitative metrics (team size, deal size, sales cycle, stakeholder count) and explain decision drivers and engagement approaches to guide GTM and sales prioritization.",
