I selected three distinct company archetypes that align tightly with Salesforce's product strengths: large financial institutions (strong fit for Financial Services Cloud, Data Cloud, MuleSoft, Tableau), mid-market UK retailers (Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Experience Cloud) and mid-market North American healthcare revenue-cycle organizations (Health Cloud, Financial Services/Health-specific integrations, Data Cloud). Location choices reflect practical go-to-market targeting (United States, United Kingdom, North America) and company_size_range decisions were based on typical buying behavior and complexity for each vertical. Job title lists and seniority ordering follow the provided master patterns and industry buying mappings; excluded titles remove common false positives and non-decision-maker roles. CRM data was not provided and therefore not used in persona selection or field values.",
