CRM data was not provided, so personas were generated from Stripe's public web content (product pages, changelog, newsroom) and industry best practices. Web content influenced location choices (Stripe's global footprint and explicit EU/APAC expansion informed geographic focus), industry selections (product-market fit: Billing/Payments → B2B SaaS; Connect/Treasury → Marketplaces; Terminal/Checkout/Tax → Retail & E-commerce), company_size_range (enterprise signals and customer logos guided larger ranges for SaaS and retail; marketplace scale indicated mid-market ranges), and job_titles (buyer functions mapped to product docs and typical procurement stakeholders: revenue/ops for SaaS, platform/finance/compliance for marketplaces, commerce/marketing/ops for retail). Job title lists follow the master patterns for seniority and include variations to maximize match coverage.",
