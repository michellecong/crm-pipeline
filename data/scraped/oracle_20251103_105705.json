As a founding member of Oracle's cloud engineering team, Clay has overseen the design, implementation and business success of Gen2 of OCI. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen2 is a high-performance, secure, cost-efficient platform that powers both hyperscale public cloud datacenters and gigawatt-scale AI Training datacenters. Under his leadership, OCI has achieved unprecedented growth and has become the go-to platform for AI training and inference.\n\nMike Sicilia, formerly President, Oracle Industries, brings deep expertise in vertical applications and applied AI. Joining Oracle through the acquisition of Primavera Systems, Mike's engineering teams pioneered the use of intent-based application generation to replace traditional coding for building Oracle applications. His teams also added very sophisticated sets of AI Agents to our industry application suites—including healthcare, banking, communications, utilities, hospitality and retail. These new AI cloud applications deliver comprehensive, end-to-end solutions to both regulated and traditional industries.\n\nLarry Ellison, Oracle's Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer, stated, \"Humanity is investing enormous resources in the race to advance Artificial Intelligence. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is playing a major part in that effort. Clay's years of experience leading Oracle's large, fast-growing Cloud Infrastructure business has demonstrated his readiness for a CEO role. Mike has spent the last several years modernizing Oracle's Industry applications businesses—including Oracle Health—by completely rebuilding those applications using the latest AI technologies. A few years ago, Clay and Mike committed Oracle's Infrastructure and Applications businesses to AI—it's paying off. They are both proven leaders, and I am looking forward to spending the coming years working side-by-side with them. Oracle's future is bright.\"\n\nTogether, CEOs Magouyrk and Sicilia will continue to collaborate on building complete industry suites of AI applications on top of Oracle's rapidly evolving AI Database and Cloud Infrastructure. \"We are excited to lead Oracle into the AI era, where technological innovation leads to extraordinary business opportunity and hyper-growth,\" said Magouyrk and Sicilia in a joint statement. \"Our combined strengths in AI, cloud infrastructure, horizontal applications and industry applications, will enable Oracle to deliver the latest AI capabilities to our customers.\"\n\nSafra Catz, who has served as Oracle's CEO since 2014, has been appointed to serve as Executive Vice Chair of the Oracle Board of Directors. Larry Ellison, Oracle's Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer, said, \"Safra led Oracle as we became a hyperscale cloud powerhouse—clearly demonstrated by our recent results. In her role as Vice Chair, Safra and I will be able to continue our 26-year partnership—helping to guide Oracle's direction, growth and success.\"\n\n\"Today, Oracle is recognized as the cloud of choice for both AI training and inferencing. I'm very proud of that,\" said Safra Catz. \"Oracle's technology and business have never been stronger. And our breathtaking growth rate points to an even more prosperous future. At this time of strength is the right moment to pass the CEO role to the next generation of capable executives. Congratulations Clay and Mike.\"\n\nOracle also announced that Mark Hura, currently EVP of Oracle North America Sales, is being promoted to President, Global Field Operations.  Doug Kehring, current EVP of Operations, is being promoted to Principal Financial Officer.\n\nThe company also reaffirmed the financial guidance provided on its September 9, 2025, earnings conference call.\n\nOracle will host a conference call and live webcast at 8:00 a.m. Central Time to discuss today's announcement. The live webcast will be available on the Oracle Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.\n\n**About Oracle** Oracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

It specializes in database software and enterprise software products, including enterprise resource planning (ERP), human capital management (HCM), customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise performance management (EPM), customer experience commerce (CX commerce), and supply chain management (SCM).\n\nThe company is increasingly focused on supporting generative AI across its database, infrastructure, and applications offerings. Oracle has a market cap of $659 billion, making it the 11th largest tech company in the world.\n\n## Oracle news and analysis:\n\n### Oracle’s big bet for AI: Zettascale10\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is not just going all-in on AI, but on AI at incredible scale. This week, the company announced what it calls the largest AI supercomputer in the cloud, OCI Zettascale10.

Forrester projects there will be roughly 10,000 more by the end of December.  Even though that is not a massive number for a company with a worldwide workforce of 160,000 employees, analysts predict that it is still likely to have a noticeable impact on operations and product lines.\n\n### Oracle appoints two CEOs, but the power still rests with Larry Ellison\n\n_September 22, 2025:_ Oracle announced on Monday that it is replacing longtime CEO Safra Catz, who has held that role since 2014.

The customer has yet to be named, but the commitment could ultimately comprise a quarter to a third of Oracle’s revenues in FY2028, based on its most recent fiscal year revenue of $57.4 billion.\n\n### Larry Ellison has big ambitions for Oracle’s cloud business\n\n_June 27, 2025:_ Having initially downplayed the importance of the cloud over a decade ago, the Oracle founder announced in a Q4 earnings call that Oracle aims to become No. 1 in three key areas: cloud databases, cloud applications, and the construction and operation of cloud data centers.\n\n### The key to Oracle’s AI future\n\n_June 16, 2025:_ Making its database and cloud services ‘AI-centric’ has brought Oracle newfound momentum. It still needs to figure out developers.\n\n### Oracle’s struggle with capacity meant they made the difficult but responsible decisions\n\n_June 12, 2025:_ Oracle knew that a massive wave of orders was coming, but they refused to build out infrastructure until contracts were signed. They faced an impossible choice: Insufficient capacity or excess capacity.\n\n### Oracle to spend $40B on Nvidia chips for OpenAI data center in Texas\n\n_May 26, 2025:_ Oracle is reportedly spending about $40 billion on Nvidia’s high-performance computer chips to power OpenAI’s new data center in Texas, marking a pivotal shift in the AI infrastructure landscape that has significant implications for enterprise IT strategies.\n\n### Oracle releases FIPS-validated crypto module for Java\n\n_April 30, 2025:_ Oracle has announced Oracle Jipher, which makes cryptographic services available for Java developers using the standard Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) framework.\n\n### Nvidia AI supercluster targets agents, reasoning models on Oracle Cloud\n\n_April 29, 2025:_ Oracle has deployed thousands of Nvidia GPUs across its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure cloud service to be used develop and run next-generation reasoning models and AI agents.\n\n### Has Oracle knocked SAP off the ERP throne?\n\n_Apr 23, 2025:_ A new study estimates that Oracle became the leading provider of ERP applications in 2024, stealing a position that SAP had held since the early 1980s.\n\n### Oracle quietly admits data breach, days after lawsuit accused it of cover-up\n\n_April 3, 2025:_ Oracle has finally admitted to suffering a significant data breach, quietly notifying select customers about the security incident just days after being hit with a class action lawsuit that accused the tech giant of attempting to conceal the breach from affected users.\n\n### Oracle warns customers of health data breach amid public denial\n\n_April 1, 2025:_ Oracle’s healthcare subsidiary, Oracle Health, has suffered a data breach, potentially exposing customers’ sensitive data, the company told some of its customers.\n\n### Roundup: AMD closes ZT deal, teams with Rapt, bands with Oracle\n\nApril 1, 2025: Oracle has announced the availability of fifth generation AMD Epyc processors (codenamed “Turin”) on its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) cloud services.\n\n### Oracle releases ML-optimized GraalVM for JDK 24\n\n_March 25, 2025:_ Oracle has released GraalVM for JDK 24, an alternative Java Development Kit tuned to just-released JDK 24 that uses ML (machine learning)-based profile inference to boost peak performance by about 7.9% on average on microservices benchmarks, the company said.\n\n### Oracle Cloud breach may impact 140,000 enterprise customers\n\n_March 24, 2025:_ A threat actor has reportedly breached Oracle Cloud infrastructure, exfiltrating six million sensitive authentication records and potentially endangering more than 140,000 enterprise customers.

They always bring a well-informed perspective on key business and societal trends, which is instrumental in shaping the direction, focus, and narrative of our joint research. Workplace Intelligence never fails to amaze me with their passion, intensity, commitment to quality, and relentless focus on achieving the desired results and delivering the best value for their clients. I’m looking forward to collaborating with them on future projects that will continue to drive the conversations around the future of work.”_– SVP, Oracle Cloud HCM\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- 78% of the workforce say the Covid pandemic has negatively affected their mental health.\n- 76% of workers believe their company should be doing more to support their mental health.\n- 68% of workers should prefer to talk to a robot over their manager about stress and anxiety at work.\n- 75% of workers say AI has helped their mental health at work by giving them necesary information for their jobs (31%), automating tasks (27%), and reducing stress (27%).\n\n## Business Results\n\nMainstream media coverage: The research report was launched on October 7, 2020, and received coverage in over 640 media outlets worldwide including The Wall Street Journal, Axios, Reuters, Fast Company, Yahoo! Finance, BBC World News, VICE, The World Economic Forum, MarketWatch, Forbes, CNBC, Human Resource Executive, Cheddar TV, AdAge, TechRepublic, Thrive Global, LinkedIn News, Digiday, HRM Asia, Nasdaq, Human Resources Director, The Economic Times, Staffing Industry Analysts and eMarketer.\n\n## Awards\n\n- 2022 Bulldog Gold Award for “Best Content Marketing Campaign”\n- 2022 PRSA Anvil Award Shortlist • 2021 Ragan Award for best Global Media Relations Campaign\n- 2021 Marketing Interactive PR Award for “Best Use of Virtual Platforms (B2B)”\n- 2021 Bulldog Bronze Awards for “Best Use of Research” and “Best Global Campaign”\n- 2021 Finalist for SABRE Award for “Superior Achievement in Research and Planning”\n\nIcon Color\\_2\n\nIF YOU ENJOYED THIS CONTENT, PLEASE SHARE: ↓\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\n#### Receive our exclusive insights every week to stay up-to-date on the latest workplace trends impacting your business and career.​\n\nSign up and receive your first premium workplace article PLUS a bonus white paper!​\n\nFirst Name\n\nBusiness Email\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW FOR FREE\n\nPicture of Dan Schawbel\n\n#### Dan Schawbel\n\nManaging Partner of Workplace Intelligence and New York Times bestselling author.\n\nSee More Posts →\n\nPrevPreviousSeasoning Hiring 2020 Study\n\nNextTrust in the Workplace StudyNext\n\nCopyright © 2025 WorkplaceIntelligence.com – Design by Charfish Design\n\n- Disclaimer\n- Privacy Policy\n- Credits",
